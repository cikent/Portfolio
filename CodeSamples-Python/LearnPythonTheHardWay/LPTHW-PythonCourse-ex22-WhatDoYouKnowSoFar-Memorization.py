# List of Words:
# ==================================
# Argv | List Variable containing the Arguments passed to it for an associated Script.
# Array | Variable containing objects constrained to the same Type, similiar to Lists, enclosed with: array([x,y])
# Boolean | Variable type Set as two constant objects False Or True as an arithmetic operator.
# Close | Function that Closes a given File Object to remove the contents from Memory.
# Complex | Variable type containing (J) Contains integer in the range 0 to 255.
# Comment | Way to block out a segment of Code to make the Compiler NOT execute the corresponding Text.
# DBES | Mnemonic for Decode Byes Encode Strings.
# Decode | Function decode() decodes the string using the codec registered for encoding.
# Def | Function used to create a user-defined function object.
# Encode | Function encode() encodes the string using the codec registered for encoding.
# Errors | 
# F-String | Literal String which contains expressions contained in braces.
# Float | Variable type containing (.) floating point real values.
# From | 1st Part of the import Statement; this Keyword allows the script to load various Libraries.
# Import | 2nd Part of the import Statement; this Keyword loads a specific Module from a given Library.
# Input | Function to store User provided textual input and store it into a Variable.
# Integer | Variable type containing a #.
# List | Variable type containing a series of values, enclosed with []'s; unlike Tuplies, Lists are mutable.
# Long | Variable type containing (L) Long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal.
# Open | Function to Open a given File Object so additional actions can be taken against the File Object.
# Print | Function that Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
# Print Format | Print Function allowing for Variables present value to be dynamically printed.
# Read | Function allowing a FileObject's contents to be Read and stored in memory.
# Repr | Return the canonical string representation of the object.
# Return | Function used to pass declared object values during the Exit of another Function.
# Sorted | Function returns a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.
# String | Variable type containing text.
# Strip | Function for Strings that removes characters from both left and right based upon the argument specified.
# Sys | This module provides access to objects and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
# Truncate | Function that deletes the contents of a given File Object.
# Tuple | Variable type containing a series of values, enclosed with ()'s; Tuples are fixed in size once assigned.
# Variable | Container for a type of value.
# Write | Function that Saves the Content/Data stored in Memory to a File Object.
